# Longplay
Modern, cross-platform music player written in C# for .NET Core 5.
Uses BASS/ManagedBass as playback engine and Avalonia for GUI.

Also a project for Advanced Object-oriented Programming subject, at least for now.

## TODO
- Music playback from local files and network streams (BASS)
- Transcoding (BASSenc)
- Portable GUI (Avalonia, ReactiveUI)
